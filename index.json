[{"content":"Ever felt the need to have a local server set up so that you can test your webpages or just outright share some stuff(on same wifi that is).\nThis can be easily achieved by any computer that has python on it as it comes with its own server which can be accessed by the following command:\npython -m http.server 1234 Here 1234 is the port number which can be any open port of your choice.\nYou can access the server via your own IP followed by port like http://192.168.137.35:1234/. You get your IP by using ip a on linux and ipconfig on windows.\nBut I wanted a oneline solution that can easily start a server in the current directory and also show a QR according to IP as when on DHCP sometimes the local IP changes.\nSo its time to lay some PIPES now o_O\nGetting the IP You can get IP from ip a but that gives too much info, another tool could be used to get it directly but I\u0026rsquo;d prefer one regex pattern over 100 random tools. So we use the good old grep command with pattern matching to get the IP.\nip a | grep -E -o \u0026#34;([0-9]{1,3}[\\.]){3}[0-9]{1,3}\u0026#34; But this gives all the IPs, we only require the second one in order to get that we use sed to filter the output.\nip a | grep -E -o \u0026#34;([0-9]{1,3}[\\.]){3}[0-9]{1,3}\u0026#34; | sed -n \u0026#39;2p\u0026#39; Final oneliner We now combine this with echo and pipe the output into qr and then start the server to get things up and running. I personally add this whole with an alias in my .bashrc for ease of use; alternatively a script can also be created.\necho \u0026#34;http://$(ip a | grep -E -o \u0026#34;([0-9]{1,3}[\\.]){3}[0-9]{1,3}\u0026#34; | sed -n \u0026#39;2p\u0026#39;):1234/\u0026#34; | qr \u0026amp;\u0026amp; python -m http.server 1234 I use python-qrcode to generate qrcodes.\n","permalink":"https://nakul.tech/posts/python-local-server/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEver felt the need to have a local server set up so that you can test your webpages or just outright share some stuff(on same wifi that is).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can be easily achieved by any computer that has python on it as it comes with its own server which can be accessed by the following command:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003epython -m http.server \u003cspan style=\"color:#ae81ff\"\u003e1234\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere \u003cstrong\u003e1234\u003c/strong\u003e is the port number which can be any open port of your choice.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Python Local Server"},{"content":"I had earlier solved this issue in my previous arch DWM build but that was somehow broken; so had to configure this again.

So in order to get rid of this I tried ffmpeg to convert video files into GIFs. You must have ffmpeg installed in your device to proceed, download link here.\nThe following command will do the trick:\nffmpeg -ss [start_time] -t [duration/no_of_seconds_from_start] -i [input].[extension(.mp4)/(.mkv)] -vf \u0026#34;fps=10,scale=[width]:[height]:flags=lanczos,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse\u0026#34; -loop 0 [output].[extension(.mp4)/(.mkv)] Summary Let me break it down for you:\nThe -ss and -t flag give the start time and how many seconds to take from that time for the GIF from the video, if the video is already clipped/you need the whole video just remove these flags.\nThe -i is to specify the input file.\nThe -vf flag specifies the properties of the GIF to be made you can change fps of GIF here (higher fps=larger file size) also in scale= you can provide the width and height of the GIF. If you need to change one dimension only/keep aspect ratio same as of video just provide one of the height/width and other as -1 the latter will taken care of by ffmpeg. The last argument of this flag is generating the pallete for the GIF which I would suggest to keep as is.\nYou can also give the flag -loop 0 for the GIF to loop the animation. And then just provide the output file name.\nAnd there you learned how to make GIFs in command line today! Cheers!\nExample The following command converts a video starting from 00:00:10s till the next 4 seconds with 10 fps and 200px width keeping the aspect ratio same.\nffmpeg -ss 10 -t 4 -i Bojji_OP.mp4 -vf \u0026#34;fps=10,scale=200:-1:flags=lanczos,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse\u0026#34; -loop 0 bojji_200.gif ","permalink":"https://nakul.tech/posts/ffmpeg-gifs/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSometime you need a GIF for your README or presentations but those online convertors are very annoying filled to the brim with ads and limited options.
